This is a multiplayer or single player tower defense video game my team made in Unity. This was a part of my Unity Multiplayer and Networking class. I was the lead of a group of 3. I managed the networking, path finding, path creation, and more.

# Instructions

1. If you want to just run the game, then open the build folder and run the exe. If you want to import into Unity, then just open the Unity Project folder in Unity.
